### Scraper for UMN classroom schedule listing

This script will eventually run on a server, to be pinged for info.  
Therefore we won't concern ourselves too much with version issues since 
they'll be determined on the server.

To get started:
- make sure you have pip and virtualenv
- `virtualenv venv`
- `. venv/bin/activate`
- `pip install -r requirements.pip`
