## UMN classroom schedule listing  

This project seeks to create an easy interface to UMN classroom schedules by providing a 
lookup for gaps in classroom usage along with classroom info.  

It's quite possible to use this as a standalone script to populate a database, but we thought 
hosting it somewhere was better.  

### The Scrapers
To get fresh html source data, run the main scraper (`scraper.py`). Or for 
a marginally faster scrape, `DEBUG=true python scraper.py`  which will use 
the EastBank.html dump for testing.  

This supplies you with the sqlite3 database

### The web app
The Flask app accesses the db created by scrapers and allows you to interact with it.
At the moment, it's hosted [here](http://brontasaur.us)

### Starting the app
To get started:
- make sure you have pip, virtualenv, and sqlite3 installed
- `virtualenv venv`
- `. venv/bin/activate`
- `pip install -r requirements.pip`
- `python app.py`
